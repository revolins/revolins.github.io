Hello, I am a second-year PhD Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, advised by Dr. Jiliang Tang in the DSE Lab. Before joining MSU, I received my M.S in Computer Science from CSU - Chico and my B.S. in Computer Science from Cal Poly Humboldt. My research work focuses on Link Prediction and Graph Generation. I have served as a reviewer for ICLR, KDD, WSDM, AAAI, NeurIPS, and MIR. I am a recipient of the MSU Engineering Distinguished Fellowship and NRT WaterCube Fellowship.

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
